# The 'Doing Right Now' Stack:

- Continue mapping user input strings to the respective Character methods in the commandsMap object.
- Get the BG3 class icons into the project and have the Characters list page use them as the profile pictures.
- Make the Roll string's breakdown accessible via a tooltip that shows on hover. The output itself should just be the value.
