- The weapon class
Weapons are a special kind of item in that they have a structure to them:
```
Weapon Mastery: Every weapon in 5e-2024 has a weapon mastery property, each that does something unique when the weapon is used

Weapon property: Weapons have other innate properties such as 'Light' or 'Two-Handed'.
```

- Action class
should take a ctx and logic property that are determined on initialization. The ctx will hold all the building blocks of the logic. 
It will be run through an action(...beforeHooks, ...afterHooks) method that will optionally perform something on the blocks either
before or after the logic() runs.
