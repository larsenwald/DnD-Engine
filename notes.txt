- The weapon class
Weapons are a special kind of item in that they have a structure to them:
```
Weapon Mastery: Every weapon in 5e-2024 has a weapon mastery property, each that does something unique when the weapon is used

Weapon property: Weapons have other innate properties such as 'Light' or 'Two-Handed'.
```
Thus, it might be a good idea to give the weapon class a bunch of prototypical properties that are functions which can be stuck onto any given weapon. These functions will contain logic.
